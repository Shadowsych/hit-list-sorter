# Hit List Sorter
https://shadowsych.github.io/simple-hit-list-sorter/

This program assumes that the end of hit line will contain the number of points, so it will sort in descending order by that number.

### Example
For example, placing this inside of the first textbox:  
test1@gmail.com:12345 | Points = 50  
test2@gmail.com:12345 | Points = 125  
test3@gmail.com:12345 | Points = 75  

Will produce this output:  
test2@gmail.com:12345 | Points = 125  
test3@gmail.com:12345 | Points = 75  
test1@gmail.com:12345 | Points = 50
